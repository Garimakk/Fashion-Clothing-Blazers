Fashion-Clothing-Blazers
========================

With winter quickly approaching, picking up a few colorful jackets, can be the perfect solution to wearing your favorite spaghetti tops and colorful stoles. If your work place like mine has minimal temperatures, it can serve as a yearlong investment. 
 Browns work as a safe and the best repetitive option, as they go with almost every mood and setting.
During the day, they are best paired with bright floral, those favorite pair of jeans and simple flats.
Head out for the girls night out, by throwing it over that perfect black dress with some chic jewelry and of course, 
those high heels.
Body, edgy and ubercool, colored jackets add a splash of color and instantly brighten up your look. 
It however, does help to play down the rest of your wardrobe with grays and simple tones, so your jacket gets the attention it deserves.
Remember to keep the ensemble balanced- Skinny, well-fitted trousers, go best with well cut blazers that add volume.
Frilly dresses, skirts and harem pants are better defined with a fitted blazer that clings perfectly to your waist and shoulders.
My favorite: Would absolutely go for the elegant white, and let it effortlessly enhance my somber nudes and pastels!
